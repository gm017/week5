i... don't understand wat ur trying to say but nice collection
Immanuel Castro Thanks you mate, just for fun only 
I definitely need a frogman. Thinking GWF-1000 or D1000 
 GWF better than D1000 I think
  I like the look more. But I like the carbon strap and sapphire on the D1000
  D1000 is far superior in my book. Sapphire, DLC, carbon strap and the overall I like the look more on the other ones. They're more classic frogman imo. But technically it's far superior for sure
  I thought if DST was enabled and the clock had to be set back today it would automatically do it however mine did not
  I very carefully set my AWG-M100B to Auto last night and it did not fall back last night. Is there another step that needs to be done? Eastern time zone, US, so it's set to NYC.
  Needs to be on auto. On or off are manual.
And it needs to know your time zone. Not all watches do even if they have auto as an option.
I just changed mine to Auto and use the app to set the clock and everything is working great no issues so that is the issue and you have explained it very well thank you
Which watch? Is it mb6, if so, it should be set to auto.
If not, you have to toggle between off in the fall and on in the spring.
However mine was setup, it worked. lol
Did mb6 sync?
I have the square G-Shock I cannot exactly remember the model number
Somebody said to set the DST to Auto and I just realized mine was not on auto so I used the app and reset the time and it fixed it so the DST does have to be set on auto thank you for whoever told me that
